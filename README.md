# Car-Price-Prediction
In this Linear Regression project, our objective was to develop a model using the Spark distributed data processing framework to predict the selling price of new cars based on predictors such as transmission type, fuel type, car name, owner, and manufacturing year. The integration of MongoDB with Spark provided efficient data management and analysis capabilities. However, the initial model achieved an R2 score of 0.45, indicating room for improvement. Further investigations, including residual analysis, feature importance assessment, and evaluation of assumptions, were recommended to refine the model. Exploring alternative regression algorithms, feature engineering techniques, and regularization methods, as well as employing cross-validation, were suggested to enhance the model's performance. Despite the current limitations, this project holds the potential to aid car sellers, buyers, and dealerships in estimating car selling prices, contributing to better decision-making in the automotive market.
